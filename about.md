The project **Linked Open Dictionaries (LiODi)** aims at developing methodologies and algorithmic solutions to facilitate research on comparative lexicography in the context of linguistic, cultural, sociological and historical studies. In particular, we develop a workbench that facilitates the cross-linguistic search of semantically and / or phonologically related words in various languages. Along with applications in the humanities, it also demonstrates the potential of (Linguistic) Linked Open Data for research problems in philology, historical sciences and linguistics. A brief project description can be found [here](http://www.acoli.informatik.uni-frankfurt.de/liodi/workbench.pdf).


LiODi is a joint effort of the Applied Computational Linguistics (ACoLi) lab at the Institute of Computer Science and the Institute of Empirical Linguistics at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany. We closely collaborate with both institutes in research and teaching, as well as with the Frankfurt Centre for the Digital Foundation of Research in the Humanities, Social, and Educational Sciences (CEDIFOR). The project is funded by the German Ministry for Education and Research as an Early Career Research Group on eHumanities. In the pilot phase (**December 1st, 2015 - November 30th, 2016**), we focus on _Turkic languages and selected contact languages_ (esp., Iranian, Slavic, Caucasian, Arabic), in the main phase (**December 1st, 2016 - November 30th, 2020**), we extend the workbench and our methodology to other language families and _language-indepdent functionalities_.
